 # Quiz Scoring System
In this quiz application, the scoring mechanism is based on both the correctness of each answer and a "streak" system that rewards consecutive correct answers.

Correct Answer:
When you answer a question correctly, you receive 10 points plus a bonus equal to your current streak (the number of consecutive correct answers you have given up to that point). After a correct answer, your streak increases by 1.

Incorrect Answer:
If you answer a question incorrectly, no points are added, and your streak resets to 0.
